Summary

Finaly after more than three weeks with wokrking on this project I hope it works correctly now.

regretfully, there is not much changes pushed to github,
and that because i did the project in many different ways
due to lack of information i did miss:
first time i built the project with Typescript and express.js but the images i built it with HTML 
and found a way to link it with the express server after i done, then i remembered that udacity said i should build it with only typescript
so  

the second time i didn't notice the readme file on github for the project so i built the URL customization sizes with a way that use svg images,
when i found that there is a readme file in github that udacity made tells me that i should use a library called sharp, then i start over again
and learning how to do it with this library

*i'm gonna continue the read me file in another time then push my commited changes to the repo :) *
